Simple C# implementation of the Game Theory Prisoners Dilemma game.
Made for .NET 7, just make sure to have Visual Studio, no extra reference packages required.
A bot can in a match choose to cooporate or defect and for each choise can get a reward depending on the other players action as perfectly explained in "What The Prisoner's Dilemma Reveals About Life, The Universe, and Everything" from Veritasium on Youtube.

You can create your own strategy by simply creating a bot in the BOT folder which implements IBot. You get a list with moves made previously in the game so you can adjust your strategy for your next move accordingly.
